# 🛒 Store Inventory Management System

This is a command-line based Python program designed to help manage a store's inventory efficiently. It supports operations such as adding new items, updating stock, tracking low-stock items, searching by category, and calculating the total value of inventory.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Add new inventory items with name, price, stock, and category  
- ✅ Update stock quantities (add/remove)  
- ✅ Search items by category  
- ✅ Detect low-stock items (≤ 5 units)  
- ✅ Calculate total inventory value  
- ✅ User-friendly menu-driven interface  
- ✅ Input validation and graceful error handling  
- ✅ Currency formatting in `$XX.XX` style  

## 🧠 Key Concepts Used

- Nested dictionaries  
- String formatting  
- Input validation  
- Looping and conditionals  
- Searching and filtering  
- Mathematical operations  

## 🧾 Data Structure

Inventory items are stored in a nested dictionary format:

```python
inventory = {
    "item_name": {
        "price": float,
        "stock": int,
        "category": str
    }
}
````

### Example:

```python
{
    "apple": {"price": 0.5, "stock": 10, "category": "fruit"},
    "milk": {"price": 2.5, "stock": 2, "category": "dairy"}
}
```

## 📋 Menu Options

1. **Add new item** – Add a new product with details.
2. **Update stock (add/remove)** – Increase or decrease stock levels.
3. **Search items by category** – Find items by their category (e.g., dairy, bakery).
4. **Check low stock items** – List all items with 5 or fewer units in stock.
5. **Calculate total inventory value** – Sum of all item values in stock.
6. **Exit** – Quit the program safely.

## 💻 How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed (Python 3+).
2. Clone this repository or download the script file.
3. Run the program in your terminal:

```bash
python inventory_manager.py
```

## 🧪 Sample Output

```text
--- Store Inventory Menu ---
1. Add new item
2. Update stock (add/remove)
3. Search items by category
4. Check low stock items (≤5 units)
5. Calculate total inventory value
6. Exit
Select an option (1–6): 1
Enter item name: cereal
Enter item price: 3.50
Enter item stock quantity: 20
Enter item category: breakfast
Cereal added successfully.
```

## 🛡️ Error Handling

* Non-numeric input for price or stock prompts a retry.
* Updating stock does not allow negative total stock.
* Invalid menu choices are caught and handled.

## 📌 Future Enhancements

* Export/import inventory data to/from a JSON or CSV file
* Add a GUI interface using Tkinter or PyQt
* Set custom low-stock thresholds per item
